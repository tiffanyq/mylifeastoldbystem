      <div id = 'description'>"my life as told by STEM" is a run by an Engineering Physics student. she likes relating the concepts she learns in class to her life, because she finds that it:
      <ul>
      <li>humanizes STEM</li>
      <li>helps her remember and understand concepts</li>
      <li>gives her comfort</li>
      </ul>
      she hopes "my life as told by STEM" also helps you with conceptual understanding, navigating life, or both; if you're not into this kind of thing, she hopes that it at least gives you something to eyeroll at.<br/><br/>you can find her at <a href="http://www.tiffanyquon.com/">www.tiffanyquon.com</a>.</div>
