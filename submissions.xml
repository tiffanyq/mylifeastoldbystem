	<text>The universe eventually moves from order to disorder, and the measure of this is entropy. Don’t worry if you’re moving towards disarray. In a sense, the universe is, too, and it’s done some pretty amazing things.</text>

	<title>self-version control</title>
	<image>images/vc.jpg</image>
	<text>When I meet up with old friends, I find myself scared—what if I’m not the same person that I used to be, and that old person is the version of me that they liked? Do versions overwrite each other? Do they stack? I don’t know, but I know I need to be, in general, happy with the direction that my commits are going. I’m carrying all these versions with me—and if I’m happy with them, that’s all I can ask for.</text>

	<title>we all feel stress and strain, and we all yield</title>
	<image>images/stressstrain.jpg</image>
	<text>The objects around you are undergoing stress and strain all the time. They all have yielding points, too. It’s okay! It’s natural to be able to deal with some stress/strain, and to break at some point.</text>

	<title>the intermediate value theorem</title>
	<image>images/ivt.jpg</image>
	<text>With respect to this reference image, the intermediate value theorem states that if we have two points connected by a continuous curve, one above and one below the line, you have to cross that line to get from a to b. This seems obvious, but it’s something I forget about my own life. To get from one place to another, I’ll have to go through the points in between. It’s a process, and it’s reassuring when I remember I don’t have to teleport into greatness.</text>
